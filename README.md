DCPO
=========

### Dynamic Comparative Public Opinion

The study of comparative public opinion has been hampered by data that is sparse, that is, unavailable for many countries and years; incomparable, i.e., ostensibly addressing the same issue but generated by different survey items; or, most often, both.  `DCPO` is an R package for estimating latent public opinion from cross-national survey data to maximize the information gleaned from available sources, overcome issues of missing and incomparable data, and allow comparativists to examine the dynamics of public opinion across countries.

For a detailed description, see [the working paper here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d5n9p/).

### Installation

```r
# For the latest stable version
install.packages("DCPO", dependencies = TRUE)

# For the latest developing version
remotes::install_github("fsolt/DCPO", dependencies = TRUE)
```

`DCPO` depends on `stan`. So, please install `rstan` and `rstantools` first. 
See the detailed instruction [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started). 

Windows users may encounter some issues when installing `DCPO` due to the version or system settings.
To minimize unnecessary disturbance, we recommand to install the [proper version](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_DCPO.html) of R and `Stanheaders` package first. 
Also, when installing `DCPO`, users are recommanded to set the argument `dependencies` as "TRUE" in the `install.packages` or `remotes::install_github` functions. 

**Note**: Development of `CmdStan`, available on R via [CmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/), has far outstripped that of the `rstan` package on which DCPO is based. DCPO estimates can now be generated much, much faster (wallclock times of < 2%) by passing [the DCPO Stan file](https://github.com/fsolt/DCPO/blob/master/inst/stan/dcpo.stan) to `CmdStanR`. See [here](https://github.com/fsolt/dcpo_trust_bureaucracy/blob/1a8a87c0d1c99c32a94489066ef6c5508c1f7a1f/paper/dcpo_trust_bureaucracy.Rmd#L600) for an example.
