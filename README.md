### Dynamic Comparative Public Opinion

The study of comparative public opinion has been hampered by data that is sparse, that is, unavailable for many countries and years; incomparable, i.e., ostensibly addressing the same issue but generated by different survey items; or, most often, both.  `DCPO` is an R package for estimating latent public opinion from cross-national survey data to maximize the information gleaned from available sources, overcome issues of missing and incomparable data, and allow comparativists to examine the dynamics of public opinion across countries.

For a detailed description, see [the working paper here](https://github.com/fsolt/dcpo_article/blob/master/paper/dcpo_article.pdf).
